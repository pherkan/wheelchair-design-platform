# Dance Wheelchair
In this document the functioning of the Internet-connected Wheelchair called Dance Wheelchair will be explained. This internet-connected wheelchair lets wheelchair users dance in the same way that is being done at a gaming arcade hall. Just as the game screen shows different arrow keys for people to step on the dance platform, LED light signals of Dance Wheelchair  guide the user which direction to move, giving her/him cues to choreograph the dance. If the user moves correctly, she/he is notified with brief vibration and gets next dance cue from the LED lights. In this way, people on a wheelchair can enjoy their own DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION!

## 2 Software
Software used for this course:
1. Atom
2. Arduino IDE
3. Terminal (macOS): Connecting to the Raspberry Pi without monitor
4. Github: Team documentation
5. DCD Hub: Grafana
6. Raspbian ([downoad here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/))
7. Etcher: To flash the Raspberry Pi


## 3 Assembling the wheelchair
By using two pieces of plywood and applying these to the frame of the wheelchair, a space is created to add the Raspberry Pi, Arduino Mega and a big powerbank. For your own convenience: Make sure to attach the plywood to the frame in a way that the wheelchair is still foldable.

The feather + small breadboard and a small powerbank are attached to a spoke of the wheel to detect the rotation. First check part 5 [here](#6-Wiring) to wire the feather correctly on the small breadboard. Check part 4 for the code to flash on the feather. If the wiring is correct and the right code flashed, you can use cable ties and tape to fix these components to the wheelchair. The assembly of the wiring can be found [here](#6-Wiring) whereas an overview of the wheelchair with its components can be found [here](#7-Poster).

# In this example, we connect to a GATT service 'rotation' on the wheel, sending
# the rotation count over time. We create a random movement which needs to be executed by the user.
# When we reach the recommended number of rotations,
# we send a command to the Arduino to turn on the vibration motors for 2 seconds and to
# color the LED's correctly for the next movement.
# This code is based on the example code created by Jacky

## 7 Poster
The poster below shows an overview of the project. Although this project only implemented the IMU Sensor, LED Lights and a vibration motor, the poster shows the use of an extra IMU Sensor and the gesture sensor. Therefore the data flow shows that the user can move forward, backward, to the left and right. In the code given above it is only possible to let the user move forward and backward.
